# WebSocket From Scratch

## About This Series

I'm trying to understand how WebSockets work under the hood, so I'm starting from scratch and implementing them myself. I might not cover everything, but I’ll try to focus on the fundamentals because I believe that once the fundamentals are clear, it becomes much easier to understand the more complex parts.

I'll keep adding more chapters as I learn more about WebSockets.

## What You'll Learn

- WebSocket handshake
- WebSocket frame parser

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Familiarity with client-server architecture
